What do I want to learn or understand better ?

This week I learned a lot about the software architecture and the rules to respect to make the code more readable and easily reusable.
As a scrum master this week I understood better its role and its importance. 
The role of the scrum master is not really to manage the progress of the project and to make sure the deliverables are respected like a classic team leader.
His role is to take a step back on the work of the team in order to see who to put in touch with to move the project forward, 
to supervise the progress of the work of each person in order to help those who will not be able to finish their task at the end of the sprint 
and to take a step back on the tasks in order to redefine those that are too long.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new ?

I tried to work in groups this week in order to share my knowledge but also to learn new ones. 
Through my role of scrum master I tried to connect people who were competent on a subject with 
those who had chosen a user story that required these same skills.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s use of  Scrum/ deliveries?

As a scrum master this week I tried to get some perspective on everyone's work and their progress. 
I also used the Kpi's to redirect the team members on new goals. I also tried to connect people who were working on the same topic.
This work was a little bit complicated this week because being scum master only for one week it's complicated to have some hindsight on the kpi's, 
the skills of the members, the tasks to accomplish... But I understand that we can't do otherwise if we want everyone to have the role.
Otherwise I participated to the user stories I chose at the beginning of the week, to the meetings, to the stand up meetings, to the planning poker,...
