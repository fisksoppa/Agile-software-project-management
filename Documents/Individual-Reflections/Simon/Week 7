What do I want to learn or understand better ?

This week I focused on cleaning up and putting comments in the code. 
I realized that a lot of lines were written twice or that a lot of functions could have been optimized. 
I think that by working in a team of two and doing pair programming we would have lost much less time on proofreading. 
Another solution in this type of project would have been to make longer points at the end of the week where we all 
comment on the code so that we can share the ideas we had and that everyone is well aware of each improvement.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new ?

The weekend reflections get deeper and deeper as the sprints progress. 
That's why I think it's very important to reread what everyone writes in these team and personal reflections. 
Both for the one who writes, who can sometimes make mistakes in the method, 
as well as for the one who connects that will feed from these reflections. 
I think that the final report will be very interesting because it will be a way to talk in depth about 
everything we have learned from the agile method and to awaken new reflections for our next projects.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s use of  Scrum/ deliveries?

This week as every week I participated in all the meetings and in the writing of all the reports. 
This week I also have the role of Project Owner so we discussed between project owners about the prioritization of user stories after defining them, 
on Monday, in team. I also participated in the stand up meetings during the week. 
I tried to follow the KPI's throughout the week in order to better understand the role of the scrum master.
