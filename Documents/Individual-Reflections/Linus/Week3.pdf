Individual Reflection - Linus Magnusson - Week 3

__What do I want to learn or understand better?__

This was our first sprint week, where we went into it without a plan. And in the planning stage we kind of just freestyled it, which at the time we thought was a good idea,
since we all just wanted to get started. But as the week progressed it felt very confusing and extremely unstructured, we implemented 2 PO roles and a scrum master role.
The problem is that we didn't really follow the process of the scrum, we kind of did it out way initially which turned out to be a bad idea. So next sprint we plan to
follow the process much more carefully and structured. We want to have our focus on the agile workway instead of developing a product. I think that is the main point in 
extracting knowledge out of this course. It isn't so much about our final product, it is much more about learning how to effectively working in an agile team. 

So with our new goals and having reevaluated what is important in this long project, I have a hopeful outlook on the next sprint, more focus on the scrum and the way of working with an agile
mindset.


__How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?__

This week and in the sprint planning meeting next sprint we will all share our research which we have done this sprint, and make collective decisions on how we will setup the project,
what frameworks/API's and so on that we are going to use. We had to spend an entire sprint just researching what was possible to do and how to do it with Python, since we all have
very different backgrounds. But from what everyone has shared so far, we have very good ideas on how to build the base for the project, and then in coming sprints we can easily 
proceed. 

__What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?__

This sprint our usage of scrum was very poor, we didn't really lean into it as hard as we should have. Which is something we realized in the sprint review and will change next week.
More focus on scrum and less on producing value (it is a course about learning agile processes, not about web development). But during our meetings, I have tried to be the one leading them
and getting the group into the direction we need to go. It's hard to say since we did a pretty bad job at using scrum this week. But I am going to try to get everyone on board that
the important part of this project is the use of scrum and agile processes. Even if it at times feels weird and unnecessary to do all the steps, I will give my best effort to being the 
one that is stubborn about keeping to the protocol of scrum. 

__What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?__

This week we had our first team reflection, we sat down as a group and went through all the possible questions, and removed some that felt unnecessary for us this week. Me and 
Christian were the main note takers, summing up everyones thoughts and the disscussion about the various topics. We all shared information and noone was left out, or not participating.

We can definetly be better on the reflections as a group. This is the main part where really sticking to the protocol of the use of scrum comes in handy. Since it is the reflections and
final report that are basis for our grades, not the finished product. So if I can be the one that makes our group try to stick more to the use of scrum we will have more to say in the
reflections and final report. But I think we all realized that during this weeks reflection, we wanted to give more insightful reflections but it was very hard since we didn't do
a good job with scrum.
