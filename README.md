Make sure you have python 3.10.7. In the terminal, change directory to the inner folder Project_Donate_Blood. 

From there install the requirements.txt (pip install -r requirements.txt). 

Next in the terminal enter python manage.py runserver, this will provide a link to a port that will display the website in your browser. (Default is http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

Done! Enjoy the website.
