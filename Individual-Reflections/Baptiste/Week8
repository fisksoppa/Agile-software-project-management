Individual Reflection Week8


What do I want to learn or understand better?
This last week of work was dedicated to finish and close our github repository and to present our work to the other groups. For that we divided the tasks related to 
github but we prepared all together for the presentation because for us it was more efficient to give all our ideas directly than to let one or two people have to think 
about everything, it left less room for error. Once again we are happy with our way of working and the result given, even our TA congratulated us for the work 
accomplished with the right processes.
For my part I was in charge of signing off the githup, so I had to merge all the branches, making sure that all the modifications were present at the end. Moreover, I 
reorganized all the documents that we had already prepared upstream to meet the requirements requested at the last reading. This went very well thanks to a good
organization since the first week and therefore everything was available to me very quickly.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
Nothing to add since last sprint, always same way. Everithing is on track.


What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s use of Scrum?
This week I was the PO so I made sure that the most important tasks were done, the presentation of the website, the closing of the github while bringing more value to the users by adding an about us page and the calculation of the route between our position and the nearest place to give blood. Even if we wanted to do more with new features we couldn't because of lack of time during this last sprint.
My contribution was also to maintain the KPIs, and close the github respecting the requirements as explained earlier.
