Individual reflection Week 8 - Sígrid Vila

This week's sprint was dedicated on finishing the cleaning up, closing the github repo and doing the documentation. On monday meeting with the TA, it went very
well he was happy. Wednesday presentation, it went good, people made questions and our web worked perfectly. Thursday team reflection.All in all this week was also
successful as everyone worked and we completed all of the tasks.


What I want to understand better: this week my task was to just to help close the repo and help with the presentation on wednesday. Nothing related to coding, as it was
my purpose for this week but as it was the last sprint there wasn't a lot to do, which is good becasue we finished on time. Also last week I said I'd recall all the agile
methodology used in the course, i thought about it and yes, it's been helpful. I'll think more about it when we write the final report.
as it is the last week and like 99% of the coding is done


How can I help the other team mates learn something new: as it was the last sprint I can only say I helped with the presentation, I made it more beatiful, so maybe the
other team members liked my style.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum: same as last week. I use the Trello board by assigning myself the tasks and putting them where they correspond
(to do, done, doing...). This week we focused on what I said at the begining and the presentation. Also, contributing to Scrum I did my part of the KPIs for the 
customer satisfaction.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries: I helped in the presentation making and I had to do another task. I attended the presentation and this week we
didn't deliever anything else, well appart from the code but it was finnished last week, and I had to close the repo but the task was shared so at the end it was only 
a one person job. And I also did the KPI customer satisfaction.

The end.
