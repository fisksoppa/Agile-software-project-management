Individual Reflection - Dagobah - Linus Magnusson - Week 1

I had a vague idea of what this course would be about, some sort of way to work in a team/group. Learning how to work in a Scrum team, during the lego workshop really showed me what the benefits are. 
If we can stick to the expected ways of Scrum during the course, we will produce a good end result. 

It seems that all of us in the team are new/ kind of new to app development, so we have a lot to learn when it comes to actually developing a product in the course. 
The kind of restrictons or requirements that we are under seems to be almost non-existant (except the API/UN-goal stuff). 
It's gonna be rough to get started, since not all of us have experience in OOP-languages, so we are going to have to find ways to make it work with most likely Python. 
There seems to be a few ways to develop android apps with Python.
So we will have a lot of research to do during the first weeks. Honestly that is what feels the most difficult right now, how do we go from an idea to a finished product? 
There are so much to think about, and since the team has a lack of knowledge/experience, it's gonna be interesting to say the least.

The lego workshop scrum session didn't really showcase how to use Scrum in like the daily life of a Scrum team. We the "developers" in the team just sat at our table and built stuff with legos, meanwhile Christian and the otherScrum masters did almost all of the work.
It was too chaotic of a workshop. But when we get going with our project, we will have more user stories to work on and then the process of a Scrum will make way more sense. 
In the lego workshop we kind of just got 1 or 2 user stories per sprint and split the team in 2 and we just finished it, there wasn't really any real ordering of different user stories, no prioritization necessary.

This week we delivered the Social Contract, we all sat down in a meeting and disscusssed what we wanted to include. Everyone gave their input and we came up with a solid social contract. 

I feel like we lack so much information in general, how and what are supposed to be in the project? In the project pitch? Are we making a power point? 
The lack of concrete information regarding the assignments is a bit frustrating. What is a small app? How small is small? What do you mean by app? Android app? 
Does it need to work on a android phone? Lots of questions, very few concrete answers at the moment. Hopefully we get answers on mondays lecture.
