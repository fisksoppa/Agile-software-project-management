Individual Reflection Week 2 - Dagobah - Linus Magnusson

This week we got a lot of the background done, selecting a good project, creating a good sustainable project scope.
We went from a brainstorming meeting in the beginning of the week to having a concrete idea with some sort of different user stories we need to complete.
In the sense of the entire project, we haven't even started yet, but if we think in a smaller scope we actually are on track to where we want to be as a group.
We have come up with an idea we can all get behind, made tasks to research how we can create this web application that we want to create.

We still have ways to go in being able to call ourselves a scrum team, we still lack some clear roles. The general feeling in the group is confusion to as what we are actually supposed to do.
It feels like I have taken sort of a leadership's role in the group this week, I may not know exactly what to do but its better that someone takes control then we just keep going in circles of confusion.

The project pitch and the project scope deliviers went really smoothly to produce. In that sense we work really good as a team.
Since we have a few members who are not that confident in english, it becomes natural that we who are more confident in english takes the lead. But I still feel that everyone contributed and that noone felt left out.
Noone takes any decisions that regard the whole group alone, we have always had kind of a vote or something like that where everyone can share their opinions. 
Something that we also made sure to have in the social contract, everyone should be able to tell their opinion and be heard. No steamrolling the others. Which have went really good.

These reflections still feel kind of awkward, since we haven't really begun to implement the scrum workway. But I have no doubts its going to work well for us. Not sure if we are planning to give official roles, and if thats good or not. 
It feels like we have more driven people and some that need some guidance. But as a group it works pretty well.

It has been a pretty weird course so far, the lack of structure and requirements just makes the confusion greater. I think the course would have been way better if there were some sort of list of projects we could have chosen from, and in that case get an external PO.
Now when we have to both produce a concept/idea and then be the scrum team, the lines get kind of blurred. Having someone in charge that can give clear answers about stuff would make it easier for us students. 
And also a better introduction into the way to work agile. Now the lines get blurred and kind of confusing. But hopefully it gets more clear when we are actually working on the project.
