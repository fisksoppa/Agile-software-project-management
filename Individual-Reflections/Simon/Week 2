What do I want to learn or understand better ?

I learned a lot this week about the scrum method, first with the course on Monday and then at the beginning of our project. 
In concrete terms, I understood much better the basics of this method, especially how to plan the actions before the sprint. 
I also understood that the aim of this method was not to reduce the work to be done compared to a classic method, 
but to go further in the design of the product. 
The links with the customers are also advantages of this method.
The group work of this seminar taught me a lot of tools that I wasn't used to using like Github or Trello for example.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new ?

I have already had some courses in dynamic web application design and html and css in my training. 
I hope that I will be able to use my knowledge to share it with the rest of the team. 
I'm trying to add my ideas to the team's ideas to go further in our thinking and avoid that our application is only a copy of an existing application.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of  Scrum?

We have just started the preparation of the first sprint and therefore the product backlog list. 
I participated in the elaboration of this list and therefore of the objectives of this first sprint. 
I also took part in the first distribution of tasks for sprint 1. 
The discussions regarding the development of the project (finding ideas and presenting them) 
also correspond to the scrum method because they correspond to the preliminary exchanges at the beginning of the project with the client. 
By participating in the creation of the slides and the presentation, I contributed to the use of the scrum method.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I participated in the preparation and presentation of the slides. 
And in the writing of the project scope, in particular by working on the business model part.
