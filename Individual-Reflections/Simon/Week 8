This sprint has been a bit different from the previous ones. We have indeed finished implementing all the main functions of our application last week. 
In order to continue to add value for the customer we tried to find new features to implement. 
We went back to the features we had put in bonus when we created the project and we chose to create an about us page in our application. 
So the Kpi could be updated and the project to increase in value added compared to last week. 
We tried to add a feature that would be easy to implement (we only had one week left) and at the same time be useful to the client. 
On the other hand this week was based on the documentation of our code so we wanted to add value elsewhere. 
On the other hand, we were surprised because while documenting the code part of 
the team realized that there were very simple functions to trace routes between locations, 
so we were able to implement this function this week too, which also added value.

I think that the presentation of the group projects on Wednesday taught me a lot about the mistakes not to make and the good practices of the agile method. 
First of all I realized that some groups had chosen the wrong software at the beginning of their project and that in the end it was detrimental to them.
I think we avoided this pitfall because we took time (first sprint) to look for the most appropriate software and language for our application. 
We also sometimes took the wrong path, as for example when we chose to use Figma, 
but in the end we succeeded each time in determining what to continue using or stop.

This week we had three meetings and one presentation. 
In addition we had to do the stand up meeting and the user stories that we chose at the beginning of the week. 
We also wrote our week report. 
I participated in all these works.
