What do I want to learn or understand better ?

I would like to understand the role of the scrum master and the product owners even better. 
In particular, how the scrum master differs from a classic team leader. 
I would also like to better understand the KPIs, which ones to use and how to analyse them. 
I will try next week to determine how to link the different parts of our work. 
That is to say the HTML pages, the python app and the database. 
I would also like to understand, now that I have a better grasp of the scrum method, how it adapts to each situation in reality.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new ?

I think that now that we've done the bulk of the research and everyone has made good progress on the part they started, we'll have to pool our knowledge. 
Working in groups of 2 or 3 would be perfect. 
I think this is the best way to share our knowledge with the group.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of  Scrum?

Like every week I participated in the different steps of the method with the team (creation of user stories, sprint, sprint review). 
I have not yet been either product owner or scum master but I will have the role soon since these are rotating roles. 
I also exchanged during the week with the scrum master on the progress of the work and the limits of the tasks.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

This week I have been involved in writing the documents to be delivered. 
I could not attend the meeting on Monday because I always have another class at the same time in the afternoon. 
I also worked with Lucas on the creation of the interface in html with the figma software.
