The third week we only had one scheduled supervision session and two group meetings that we had scheduled ourselves. 

What do I want to learn or understand better?
As of right now I would like to understand how we connect to the github repository.
I would also like to look more into how we can integrate html code with our backend python code.
For now we have been researching a lot and also started with some parts, so a lot we are doing now is to understand what we want to do and what tools to use.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
So this week I was the scrum master, which was a new experience for me. 
While acting my role as scrum master it's up to me to make sure that the scrum team follows the procedures and also to remove any hindrances that emerge.
For most of the team the tasks that they have selected via Trello have gone well. 
There was only one problem which had to do with technical issues using Github that got sorted. 
I also learned how we could use a local hosted website for our application, which will make it easier to apply than on a live website.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As mentioned my role for this week was scrum master so i had the duties of the scrum master.
Which was to ask the team how things were going and if they had any issues I would try my best solving them. 
I also assigned myself to find out and also create the website (front) for our application.
Me and my team member Simon have been working on this and made some big steps. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've made use of python and command prompt to create a local hosted website, which can be used as a front for our application. 
I've also contributed to the discussions and made suggestions during the meeting. 
Lastly, I've also played the role of a scrum master during this week.
