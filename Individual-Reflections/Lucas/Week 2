During the second week we went through different types of backlogs (vertical and horizontal) and also user stories. 
We also made a pitch presentation of our application DonateBlood.

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Currently I wanna better understand how we can integrate the blood donations locations API with the map that we will create for our application.
Given that we will have many clinics, hospitals and blodbussen we will need an API so that we can easily apply this information.
Maybe I also would like to understand user stories a bit better. I don't think I fully understand the purpose and methodology of using user stories.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I'm not entirely sure how I can help someone or the entire team learn something new,
maybe I can give my opinion on how we can attack this problem in code given that I have a data science background.
In general this does seem to be the case for all group members so far but for the backgrounds that that specific person has.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
So far we haven't started with the actual project other than presenting the pitch, so we have not yet assigned roles to group members yet.
When deciding what type of project we had a meeting where we talked about what application to make and took a vote.
After the general idea was set we came up with further modifications that could make it better in different ways.
For the pitch we split the work evenly whereas I got the introduction for example.
 
What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My contribution has been mentioned in the earlier question but as said it hasn't been any big work on the project yet.
