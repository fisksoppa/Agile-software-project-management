
Short descriptions of what each modules does:

Project_Donate_Blood - the entire folder
	This folder is from the Django frameworks that takes care of the actual hosted webpages. 
	The only thing we have changed here is some forwarding of urls in urls.py, and forwarding of the template folder.
	
DBApp
	This is the folder where we have written our code.
	
DBApp / admin.py
	Admin module that registers the search database.
	
DBApp / apps.py
	Registers the name of the app (DBApp) to the Django framework.

DBApp / database.py
	Our database module, the database is a pandas.DataFrame that we have manually entered the entries. 
	If you want to expand the database you can easily import them from a CSV file or something using the DataFrame methods.
	
DBApp / forms.py
	Create the search form that checks if the search that gets entered on the site is of valid form.
	
DBApp / models.py
	Hidden SQL database that stores the searches that gets done on the webpage. 
	It has to columns, address and date, address is the actual search that a user enters, and date is automated time of the search.
	
DBApp / tests.py
	Autogenerated test module, we have not done anything in here. If we would have had more time we would have figured out how to use it. 
	
DBApp / urls.py
	Sets up the ending urls of the webpage, what views function it will run and what the name of that page is.
	
DBApp / views.py
	This is where the backend logic is implemented. Each url page has a different view method that either creates or computes the different objects for that view.
	The return value for these methods are used as variables in the HTML templates.
	Each method specifies some context, and what HTML template to use.
	

templates - this is the HTML template folder
